<h4><b>What's Out There?</b></h4>
<p>I like to start new work by knowing what’s already been tried. It’s simple, but I Googled keywords like “toolkit,” “advancement,” and “fundraising.” On CASE’s website, I found a toolkit developed by Cornell for volunteers and staff to launch their first giving day.</p>
<p>I lifted ideas for email assets, marketing strategies, and a “wall of fame” to recognize and model successful initiatives. I also gained a logical structure for my toolkit that, like Cornell’s, came in four parts: promotion & creative strategy, building the team, catalyzing activity, and emergency planning.</p>
<p>I also found inspiration in Google’s “Local Guides” and Facebook’s “Events” programs. They offered community building tools for events like checklists, best practices, and step-by-step instructions for activities. These were two powerful examples of huge organizations offering regular people the tools they needed to launch great events with minimal startup capital at any location.</p>

<h4><b>What About Dartmouth?</b></h4>
<p>I also wanted how Dartmouth, specifically, handles regional clubs for young alumni, so I called two alumni. They shared stories of success and failure regarding venues, activities, and follow-ups.</p>
<p>To get a larger sample size, I got access to Dartmouth’s databases, which included survey results from 1,479 alumni on their experiences with regional club programs and young alumni activities.</p>
<p>All this went into notes. Later, I would dig through; look for meaningful themes, insights, and actionable moves; and translate the information into a delightful toolkit.</p>

<h4><b>How'd It End?</b></h4>
<p>I presented the toolkit at the Dartmouth Alumni Relations Summer Retreat. I left time for a Q&A, so we had a great discussion and feedback.</p>

<h4><b>Lessons Learned</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Talk to real people.</b> The best insights I got came from the alumni club leaders I spoke to on the phone.</li>
<li><b>Find good examples.</b> Google and Facebook opened up whole new possibilities for the level of work I was doing.</li>
<li><b>Practice presenting.</b> Good work deserves a good presentation. I pitched my work to a few friends first, which lifted my confidence and offered me new perspectives.</li>
