      <h4>ASM Engage Week</h4>
      <b><i>How it started</i></b>
<p>The school admin proposed students be released from classes for one week to solve real-world problems. It would stop business-as-usual for 160 students and dozens of teachers to allow for, instead, something else. The school needed a dedicated team to pull it off.</p>
<p>My title was “lead engager,” and I was responsible for managing activities, volunteers, and logistics. I threw branding into the mix.</p>

<b><i>The challenges</i></b>
<p>We had two months to put together together venues, caterers, programs, support, and objectives for a 160-person event. It was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Meeting the needs of our users was tricky. Some teenagers, we knew, would rather stay home. Private, international prep-school parents expected globally-competitive performance. Teachers were skeptical of the amorphous learning opportunity and the abandonment of tried-and-tested classrooms.</p>
<p>Our final major problem was defining success. Unlike test scores, engagement is hard to turn into numbers.</p>
<p>We got to work.</p>
<b><i>Space, food</i></b>
<p>The need for space and food was imminent, so we solved it right away. One big thing to check off our list. We submitted facility request forms to the administration and sent a food budget with ideas and dietary restrictions to the school cafeteria.</p>
<b><i>Forming Teams, Organizing Facilitators</i></b>
<p>We needed to define a role for students that would afford them the magical mix of freedom and responsibility to do the work of Engage.</p>
<p>I suggested students form their own teams. Teachers needed to demonstrate the faith and intention that students could self-organize and make beautiful things happen on their own.</p>
<p>To assist students in the team formation process, we developed a survey that tabulated a hierarchy of “project personality types.” (Mine was 1. technologist, 2. presenter, 3. designer, 4. documentarian.) Students could then use this data to make informed choices about teams, balance strong and weak.</p>

<p>To make it fun, we assigned each personality type a color code using legos. With the legos as a guide, students found partners that complemented their abilities in real time. The discoveries students made walking around the room, the confirmations and surprises, was one of my favorite parts of event.</p>
<p>To assist teacher-facilitators in their work, we defined clear roles, held training sessions, and assigned “critical friends.” So, they could act knowledgeably, with confidence and support. We also held team meetings throughout the event.</p>
